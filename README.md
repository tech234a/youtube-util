# youtube-util

Given a YouTube channel `UCID`, return all playlist ids and channel ids from created playlists, saved playlists (if public), playlist shelves, featured channels, subscriptions (if public), and channel shelves.

Usage: import the `process_channel` function from `youtube_channel`, or simply run `python3 youtube_channel.py [space separated list of channel IDs]`. Requires Python 3 and the Requests module.
